# Abalone-Age-Prediction
#### **Task**
Predict the age of abalone from physical measuremnets only
#### **Problem**
The manual process of determining the age of an abalone can be a tedious and time-comsuming process. It involves cutting the shell through the cone, staining it, \
and counting the number of rings through a microscope
#### __Solution__
Create a machine learning algorithm to predict the age of an abalone from physical measurments only \
Five different models were used to determine the best performing solution
## Dataset Information
The dataset used in this project was downloaded from [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/1/abalone)
- 8 features
- 4177 instances


`Sex`: Categorical - M, F, and I (infant)

`Length`: Continuous - Longest shell measurement (in mm)

`Diameter`: Continuous - measurement perpendicular to length (in mm)

`Height`: Continuous - with meat in shell (in mm) 

`Whole_weight`:	Continuous - whole abalone (in grams) 

`Shucked_weight`: Continuous - weight of meat (in grams) 

`Viscera_weight`: Continuous - gut weight after bleeding (in grams) 

`Shell_weight`: Continuous - after being dried (in grams) 

`Rings`: Integer - +1.5 gives the age in years (Target variable)
